# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

I've been putting this quiz together to demonstrate some new concepts I am learning and perfecting. This is a quick quiz app built on the JS system. I used logged const variables as the questions and referenced their answers as radio outputs. Based on your selected answers, you will be awarded points, which show up at the end in a pop up box. There are a few elements I am still having a hard time getting to understand, but this is a working piece which will help me gain a stronger grasp on JS coding.
